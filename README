There are a few high level steps in using pipbench:
1. Graph Generation
2. Graph Resizing
3. Generating packages that correspond to the graph
4. Generating handlers

Graph Generation and Resizing: TODO
    1. Generate Graph
        // TODO, pull everything out of stats
    2. Resize Graph

1. Generate packages:
    1. Create a random file:
    dd bs=1024 count=100000 </dev/urandom >random.dat
    (You may have to increase count if generate_packages.py complains)

    2. Generate packages:
    python3 generate_packages.py graph_generation/<package_graph_spec_file> <random_file>
    
    Creates a package tar.gz for each package in the graph, under ./web dir and the html indices to match,
    using the same dir structure that PyPI uses

2. Generate handlers:
    1. Create a number of imports per handler distribution file
    
    2. Generate handlers:
    python3 generate_handlers.py graph_generation/<package_graph_spec_file> <num_imports_per_handler_file>
    Flags:
    flag: default: desc:
    -d 1 number of handlers we want written out per handler
    -n 100 number of handlers to create (before duplicating)
    -z 1.4 arg to zipfian distribution for handler->package import popularity
    -s 1 numpy.random seed, to ensure deterministic behavior
    
    Creates a directory of handlers (uncompressed) and places them in the ./handlers dir. A packages_and_size.txt folder is
    created with the list of referenced packages (and their uncompressed package sizes), and packages_handler_refcounts.txt is created, 
    relfecting the actual distribution of handler->package imports

To install a package from the local PyPI mirror
pip2 install --extra-index-url http://localhost:8080/simple/ <package name>

To install from a generated requirements.txt:
pip2 install -r test1/requirements.txt  --index-url http://localhost:9199/simple/

NOTES:
- generate_packages.py and generate_handlers.py use python3
- the generated packages target python 2
